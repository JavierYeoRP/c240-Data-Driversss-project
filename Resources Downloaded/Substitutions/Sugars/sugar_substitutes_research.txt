SUGAR SUBSTITUTE RESEARCH (DETAILED + AI-FRIENDLY)

SECTION 1: WHAT ARE SUGAR SUBSTITUTES?
Definition: Ingredients used to provide sweetness with fewer or zero calories compared to table sugar. (Sources: Wikipedia – turn1search1, Hopkins Medicine – turn1search18)
Main Types:
- Natural sweeteners (e.g., stevia, monk fruit). (Healthline – turn1search13)
- Artificial sweeteners (e.g., sucralose, aspartame). (Wikipedia – turn1search1)
- Sugar alcohols (e.g., erythritol, xylitol). (Healthline – turn1search13)
- Novel/rare sweeteners (e.g., allulose). (Wikipedia – turn1search1)

SECTION 2: NATURAL SWEETENERS
Stevia:
- Plant-based, 50–450x sweeter than sugar. (Healthline – turn1search13)
- Zero calories, does not spike blood sugar. (Healthline – turn1search13)
- Possible bitter aftertaste; may affect gut microbiome. (Healthline – turn1search13)

Monk Fruit Sweetener:
- Derived from monk fruit, zero calories. (Wikipedia – turn1search1)
- Very sweet; used as a sugar alternative in baking. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

Honey / Maple Syrup / Agave:
- Natural sugars with vitamins and antioxidants. (Hopkins – turn1search18)
- Still counted as added sugars. (Verywell Health – turn1search16)
- Higher calories than artificial sweeteners.

SECTION 3: ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS
Sucralose:
- 600x sweeter than sugar. (Wikipedia – turn1search2)
- Zero calories; doesn’t affect insulin. (Wikipedia – turn1search2)
- Stable for cooking/baking. (Wikipedia – turn1search2)

Aspartame, Saccharin, Ace-K:
- FDA-approved. (Mayo Clinic – turn1search22)
- High-intensity sweeteners, used in many diet products. (Hopkins – turn1search18)

SECTION 4: SUGAR ALCOHOLS
Examples: Erythritol, Xylitol, Sorbitol. (Healthline – turn1search13)
Characteristics:
- Fewer calories than sugar. (Healthline – turn1search13)
- Do not spike blood sugar much. (Healthline – turn1search13)
- May cause digestive upset (bloating, diarrhea). (Healthline – turn1search13)

SECTION 5: NOVEL SWEETENERS
Allulose:
- Found naturally in figs, maple syrup. (Wikipedia – turn1search1)
- 70% sweetness of sugar, very low calories. (Biology Insights – turn1search3)

SECTION 6: SUBSTITUTING SUGAR IN BAKING
Brown Sugar:
- 1:1 replacement; adds caramel flavor and moisture. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

Coconut Sugar:
- 1:1 replacement; similar flavor intensity. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

Stevia (Baking Blends):
- Replace 1 cup sugar with 1 cup stevia blend, but add moisture ingredients like banana or yogurt. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

Monk Fruit (Baking):
- Use 1/2 cup for each 1 cup sugar; may affect browning. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

Date Sugar:
- 1:1 replacement; may dry baked goods, adjust moisture. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

Sugar Alcohols for Baking:
- Erythritol/maltitol often require experimentation due to texture differences. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)

SECTION 7: HEALTH NOTES
- Added sugars (e.g., honey, maple syrup) still impact blood sugar and should be limited. (Verywell Health – turn1search16)
- Artificial sweeteners safe within Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). (Mayo Clinic – turn1search22)
- Sugar substitutes may influence gut bacteria. (Hopkins – turn1search19)

SECTION 8: SUMMARY
If goal is low-calorie sweetening: choose stevia, monk fruit, sucralose. (Healthline – turn1search13 / Wikipedia – turn1search1)
If goal is natural flavor: choose honey, maple syrup, coconut sugar. (Hopkins – turn1search18)
For baking: brown sugar, coconut sugar, date sugar, stevia blends, monk fruit work well but may require moisture adjustments. (Hersheyland – turn1search7)
